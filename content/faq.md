## Why do I have to log in with Twitter?
There are multiple reasons; Talking Pictures uses the tools of multi-media storytelling to teach and learn about multi-media storytelling. Twitter is one of those tools, arguably it has emerged as an essential tool for journalists. Twitter’s verification process verifies participants are who they say they are. It also enables us to tap into existing networks of micro conversation, meaning people in our networks who share our interests may hear about, and access the course from our notes (each tweeted note contains a link back to the section of text you referred to).

If you have any concerns about conflating you public profile with your participant-profile we suggest you set up a new account for this course.

## Why am I asked for my email address?
We will send you email reminders of when your elected time-zone’s classes are running, when the webinar reviews run and whenever you receive feedback. You can alter your email preferences at any time.

## Why do I have to choose an International Hub?
This is especially to maximise the chances of you receiving peer support in a timely fashion. If you submit an image we will pair you with someone who is also looking for feedback and always try to do it with someone in the time zone closest to the one you choose.

## Why am I being asked Questions?
Talking Pictures is part funded as a PhD research project. One of the goals of the project is to develop ways for teachers and learners to use the affordances of the web teach and learn better. Your feedback helps us to improve both the platform, the content and the experience.

## Who owns Talking Pictures?
No one owns Talking Pictures or the Connected Academy platform. The teaching and learning materials are licensed to be free to access and the platform is open source.

## Do I need my own website to participate?
Talking Pictures does not host images. We encourage participants to own their own domain and website, where you are the author of your own terms of service and you retain the rights to your images. If you want to submit images, give and receive feedback and have your work potentially reviewed by the World Press Photo Foundation webinar panel, you will need to submit  a link to a site that is able able to host a context-rich image. 

## What data are you collecting on me and how will it be used?
We collect no personal data other than your email address and Tweets. General data about participants engagement with the platform is collected but your personal identity will not be associated with it. We want to learn which bits people enjoy and spend time on, which bits people skip or leave quickly and if there are any regional differences according to where people tuned in from.

## Why is the site only in English?
We regret that we have not been able to resource multiple languages for this first iteration. We intend to expand the languages in future iterations. If you are able and wish to translate any of the content please let us know by emailing us.

## I live near to an international chapter, can I attend in person?
Some international chapters are being run within existing academic courses and participation is restricted to fee paying students. Other chapters, such as the XXXXXX are community organisations and do accept new members. Refer to the International Chapter list for more information.

## Can I run a class within my community?
Yes! See the about page!

## I have missed some of the classes can I still join?
Yes, you can join at any time. The classes are all related but they are not dependent on each other. Once released the classes can be accessed retrospectively. 

## Will I get feedback from the Hub teacher?
Not from the Hub Teacher but the Connected Academy platform, its use of Twitter, the time-zone Hubs and the live webinars are all designed to maximise the chances of participants getting timely peer feedback. Without charging for access, we do not have the resources to hire teachers. 

## Will my work be reviewed in the webinar reviews?
The panel will include a representative selection from all of the images submitted and likewise the emergent themes. We cannot guarantee that all of the submitted images will be reviewed, however the time-zone hubs and Personal Dashboard will maximise the chances of participants peer supporting.

## Can I buy online tutorial reviews?
This is something we are interested in exploring, if you would like to register your interest as a teacher willing to provide critical support, or a learner wanting feedback please register your interest by emailing us.

## Will I get accreditation for taking part?
Currently we do not offer an accreditation process, you can receive a certificate of participation by completing the questionnaire at the end of the course.
